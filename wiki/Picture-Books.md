Books whose pages are pictures (scanned pages, comics as EPUB) are fitted to the screen.

EPUBs whose chapter files are pictures with next to no text (scanned pages,
e.g. Diary of a Wimpy Kid: 385 x 625 JPEG per page) are recognized on
opening (`gzreader_picturebook.lua`: sampled spine files, ≥ 70 % pictures-only;
a book in fewer than 6 files, such as one big file between a cover and a
contents page, is cut into 12 parts and the middle 10 are sampled instead).
An EPUB converted from a PDF, whose pages are pictures with the text as
separate lines between them, isn't one: fitting its pictures can't put the
text back on the page.
GZreader then adds a book style tweak (`img { height: 100%; width: auto;
max-width: 100% }`, no margins/padding), sets the book's page margins to 0
and turns on smooth image scaling, keeping the old settings for when it's
turned off (the quick panel → Fit pictures, in a book). Checked with the
Kindle's own crengine.

`100%` is the page area between the top and bottom margins (ZenOS adds its
title-bar height to the top margin), so pictures stay clear of the title bar
and footer. 1.0.28 used `100vh`, the whole screen: pages ran under the clock
and the footer (crengine also split them, adding blank pages), and a wide
picture capped at the screen width was stretched to full height. With `100%`
crengine keeps each picture's shape. The scans are only ~385 x 625, so
they're enlarged about 1.3x to fill 800 pixels; that's why they look softer
than real text. Smooth scaling makes them much less jagged.
