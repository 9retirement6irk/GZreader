# GZreader — Grimmory + ZenOS + KOReader for the Kindle Keyboard

A trimmed KOReader for older Kindles: the Kindle 2, Kindle Keyboard (3) and
DX (keyboard), the Kindle 4 (5-way, no keyboard), the Kindle Touch and the
Paperwhite 3 (touch), that reads books, pulls them from a [Grimmory](https://grimmory.org) server
and keeps reading position, bookmarks, highlights and notes in sync with it. ZenOS is the
interface. Releases and updates: <https://github.com/9retirement6irk/GZreader>.

Based on KOReader `v2026.07.1` and ZenOS `4.2.0`. Version: see `GZREADER_VERSION`.

## What's in it

| Kept | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `zenos.koplugin` | The interface (Home, Downloads, navbar). English only. |
| `coverbrowser.koplugin` | Required by ZenOS's library views. |
| `statistics.koplugin` | Feeds ZenOS's Home reading-stats widgets. |
| `autosuspend.koplugin` | Battery. |
| `gzreader.koplugin` | GZreader itself: the phone page (QR code: connections, sending books), library browser, downloads, progress, bookmark and highlight sync, Reading menu, read aloud, updates. |

Added: an English dictionary (Open English WordNet, CC BY 4.0, 11 MB).

Removed: the other 32 bundled plugins (including KOReader's own progress
sync), SSH/SFTP binaries, KOReader's OTA updater (it would replace this
build with stock KOReader), the 16 MB CJK fallback font, UI translations and
KOReader's first-run quickstart document (ZenOS's setup guide replaces it).

## Install

1. Jailbreak the Kindle and install KUAL (see kindlemodding.org).
2. Unzip the package for your Kindle and copy its folders (`koreader`,
   `extensions`, and `launchpad` on a Kindle 3) to the root of the Kindle's
   USB drive, merging with anything already there:

   | Kindle | Package |
   | --- | --- |
   | Kindle 2, DX, Kindle Keyboard (3) | `gzreader-kindle-legacy-<version>.zip` |
   | Kindle 4, Kindle Touch | `gzreader-kindle-<version>.zip` |
   | Paperwhite 3 (7th gen), firmware 5.16.3 or newer | `gzreader-kindlehf-<version>.zip` |
   | Paperwhite 3 on firmware 5.6.1 – 5.16.2 | `gzreader-kindlepw2-<version>.zip` |

   The firmware version: Settings → Device Options → Device Info (on the
   Kindle's own home screen).
3. Eject, open KUAL → GZreader → Start GZreader. On a Kindle 3, also the launchpad shortcuts:
   Shift, G, G (last book), Shift, G, L (library), Shift, G, N (without the
   Kindle framework, more memory). The old Shift, P, … shortcuts still work.

The first start runs the setup guide: connect to Grimmory, then the library
view, keyboard, sync, sleep screen, clock and reading defaults.

## Updates

GZreader checks the latest release of github.com/9retirement6irk/GZreader
once a day (Settings → General → Updates, or Grimmory menu → GZreader
updates; the changelog is there too). Publishing an update is just making a
GitHub release:

1. Bump `GZREADER_VERSION` and add an entry to
   `plugins/gzreader.koplugin/gzreader_changelog.lua`, push.
2. On GitHub: Releases → Draft a new release → tag `v<version>` (for
   example `v1.0.4`; `v.1.0.4` also works) → Publish.

The "GZreader release packages" workflow then builds and attaches the full
installs (`gzreader-kindle-legacy-<version>.zip`,
`gzreader-kindle-<version>.zip`, `gzreader-kindlehf-<version>.zip`, `gzreader-kindlepw2-<version>.zip`) and
`gzreader-update.zip` (what every Kindle downloads, ~6 MB: Lua only, the same
for all of them). If a release has no
attached files, Kindles use the release's source code zip instead (~9 MB),
taking only `frontend/`, `reader.lua`, `koreader.sh` and the installed
plugins from it.

The download comes over HTTPS straight from GitHub (no hashing on the
Kindle); the zip must open and have a complete GZreader layout. Settings,
books, `.sdr` folders, history and the GZreader folder are never touched; if
anything fails, the previous files are put back. Then GZreader restarts.

## Which Kindle does what

| | Kindle 2, 3, DX | Kindle 4 | Kindle Touch | Paperwhite 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Use | keyboard, 5-way | 5-way, Menu | touch | touch |
| Screen | 600 × 800 (DX 824 × 1200), 16 greys | 600 × 800, 16 greys | 600 × 800 | 1072 × 1448, 300 dpi |
| Faster drawing (shadow screen) | yes | yes | (not needed) | (not needed) |
| Audiobooks | yes | — (no audio) | yes (player buttons) | — (no audio) |
| Read aloud (Kindle voice) | yes (Shift + Sym) | — | yes (Listen in the quick panel) | — |
| Volume buttons | yes | — | — | — |
| Clock | UTC: set Settings → General → Time zone | same | the Kindle's own | the Kindle's own |

KOReader's own device code decides the model from the serial number (the DX
runs as KOReader's Kindle 2 class, with its bigger screen); GZreader adapts
each screen to keys, the 5-way or touch.

## Kindle 4 (5-way)

No keyboard and no touch screen: the 5-way, its centre button (Press),
Menu, Back, Home, the keyboard key and the page keys on both sides.

- **Tabs:** Down from the bottom of Home reaches the tab bar; Left and Right
  choose a tab, Press opens it.
- **Menu:** the GZreader menu at Home (continue reading, history, sort,
  display, Send books from your phone, Wi‑Fi, settings, updates,
  diagnostics, sleep, restart, ZenOS's quick panel); the Reading menu in a
  book; in Notes and Calendar their options (new note, filter, refresh;
  today, Agenda / Day / Week / Month, refresh, settings).
- **Notes:** the 5-way moves between the sticky notes, Press opens one; in a
  note ▲ ▼ choose a checklist item or attachment and Press ticks or opens
  it; Menu: edit, pin. The editor shows the on-screen keyboard (the 5-way
  types on it); Menu goes to the toolbar (lists, checklists, headings,
  italic, bold, tags, Save, and who can see the note) and back.
- **Calendar:** the page keys go back and forth; the 5-way picks an event.
- The 8-bit screen has inverted grey levels, which KOReader's fast drawing
  code can't handle (like the Kindle 3's 4-bit one): GZreader draws into an
  ordinary buffer and copies it to the screen, about a sixth less processor
  time per key press in testing, and night mode costs nothing.

## Touch Kindles (Kindle Touch, Paperwhite 3)

The Kindle Touch (4th generation) and the Paperwhite 3 (7th generation)
run the same GZreader with ZenOS's touch interface:

- **Tabs** at the bottom: Home, Downloads, Grimmory, Notes, Calendar.
- **Swipe down from the top** for quick settings (Wi‑Fi, night mode,
  brightness, sleep, restart) and the **launcher**, which starts with
  **GZreader** (the GZreader menu: continue reading, history, sort, display,
  Wi‑Fi, settings, updates, diagnostics, sleep, restart), **Phone** (the
  phone page) and **Send books** (the phone page at Send books).
- **Notes:** New note, Filter and More are buttons under the title; a note
  opens with a tap, checklist items tick with a tap, and Edit, Pin, More and
  Close are buttons at the bottom. The editor shows the on-screen keyboard;
  its toolbar (lists, checklists, headings, italic, bold, tags) and Save are
  above the text, and the visibility (Private, Signed-in users, Public) is a
  button in the title.
- **Calendar:** ◀, Today, ▶ and More under the title (or swipe left and
  right); tap an event for its details, a day in Week or Month to open it.
- **The phone page:** tap Done on the Kindle when you're done (instead of
  Back).
- **On the Kindle's own home screen** (firmware 5), GZreader shows as a
  "GZreader" book with its logo (`documents/GZreader.sh`); tapping it starts
  GZreader. It replaces ZenOS's "ZenOS" one from earlier versions.
- **Reading:** tap the right side for the next page, the left side for the
  previous one, the top for the menu (contents, bookmarks, search, fonts…);
  swipe up for the page browser. ZenOS shows a few tips the first time.
- **Audio:** the Kindle Touch plays audiobooks; the player has buttons for
  chapters, ±30 s, play / pause, sleep timer, volume, the description and
  close (Settings → Reader → Test audiobook playback finds what works on
  its firmware). It also reads aloud with the Kindle's voice: in a book,
  swipe down from the top and tap **Listen** in the quick panel (again to
  stop); the first time, a short test finds the Kindle's voice. The
  Paperwhite has no speaker or headphone jack, so neither is offered there.
- Everything is sized for the screen (the Paperwhite's 1072 × 1448 at 300
  dpi): Home's text is the same size as on a Kindle 3. The Kindle's own time zone is used (the time zone setting is for the
  Kindles without one).

## Keyboard (Kindle 2, 3, DX)

The Kindle 2 and DX have a number row, so 1–9 switch the tabs there too.

| Where | Key | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home / lists | Z, X, C, V, B | Switch the bottom tabs, counted from the left: Z Home, X Downloads, C Grimmory, V Notes, B Calendar (also Alt + Q, W, E, R, T…: Alt + the top row is how the Kindle Keyboard types 1–9). Shown under each tab. |
| Home | Q, W…; A, S, D… | Q the book you're reading, W, E, R… the books in the strip, A, S, D… the strip's tabs (shown in squares). |
| Any list or menu | Q, W, E, … | Pick the entry with that letter (shown next to it), in lists, the ZenOS settings and KOReader's menus. |
| KOReader's menus | Alt + Q, W, E, … | Switch the menu's tabs. |
| Home / lists | Menu | GZreader menu: Grimmory library, continue reading, audiobooks, search, history, Wi‑Fi, Settings (the Settings page), KOReader settings, updates, send log, sleep, restart, Quick panel (ZenOS), exit. Replaces ZenOS's touch quick-settings panel (switch: Grimmory → Menu key opens the GZreader menu). |
| Home / Downloads, book highlighted | Menu | The GZreader menu starts with that book: Open, Delete from this Kindle (asks first; Grimmory keeps it), More options (ZenOS's book menu). **Sort books…** is always in it. |
| Reading | Menu | Reading menu: contents, bookmarks, bookmark this page, go to page, search, read aloud, fonts, sync, dictionary, page browser, book info, Settings, Quick panel, close book. |
| Reading | Hold Menu | ZenOS page browser. |
| Reading | AA | Fonts and layout. |
| Reading | Shift + Sym | Read aloud / stop. |
| Reading | Back | Return from a followed link or TOC jump; otherwise go to Home. |
| Settings, audiobook player, tab views | Home | Home (the default tab). The audiobook keeps playing. |
| Anywhere | Volume buttons | Speaker volume for audiobooks and read aloud (a note shows the level). |
| Note editor | Menu | To the formatting toolbar and back; the cursor stays where it is. |

## The phone page (QR code)

One page on your phone sets up everything: the Kindle shows a QR code, you
scan it, and the page that opens (served by the Kindle itself over your Wi‑Fi;
phone and Kindle on the same network) has a section for each connection:

- **Grimmory**: connect with a password or single sign-on, or disconnect.
- **Notes (Memos)**: the Memos address and an access token, or disconnect.
- **Calendar**: your calendars, each with *Show its events*; calendar links
  can be renamed, given a new link (Proton's links change when you reshare)
  or removed; add new links (several at once); connect or disconnect a CalDAV
  account.
- **Send books**: pick books on the phone (EPUB, PDF, MOBI, AZW3, FB2, CBZ,
  TXT, DOCX…, up to 1 GB each) and they go straight into the GZreader folder
  (the Downloads tab). No Grimmory needed. A name already there gets
  "(2)"; a book is written to a temporary file first, so a dropped Wi‑Fi
  leaves nothing half-copied; it is refused when the Kindle is short of
  space.

Each change shows a short note on the Kindle, and the page shows what
happened and stays open for the next thing. Press **Back** on the Kindle when
you're done (or leave it 10 minutes): a summary shows what changed, and the
page stops working. The page's address has a random code in it; passwords
and tokens are sent once to the Kindle and only Grimmory's login tokens,
the Memos token and the CalDAV password are kept (never logged).

Where to open it: the setup guide's first page (**Connect your phone**), Home
menu → **Send books from your phone**, the Grimmory, Notes and Calendar tabs'
*Connect with QR code*, Settings → Connections → Grimmory / Memos / Calendar.

## Connect to Grimmory

Open the **Grimmory** tab. Grimmory's options (connection, sync, bookmarks,
highlights, auto-download shelf) are in **Settings → Connections → Grimmory**
(also KOReader → Tools → Grimmory); Memos (the Notes tab) is in **Settings →
Connections → Memos (Notes)**. Read aloud is in Settings → Reader; Wi‑Fi only
when needed and the diagnostic log in Settings → General; updates in Settings
→ General → Updates.

- **Connect with QR code**: opens the phone page (above) at its Grimmory
  section. The Kindle keeps only Grimmory's login tokens (never the
  password).
- **Connect by typing**: the same, using the Kindle's keyboard.

### Single sign-on (SSO / OIDC)

If Grimmory has SSO turned on, the phone page shows **Sign in with <provider>**.
One-time setup: add `http://<kindle-ip>:8642/oauth2-callback` as an extra
redirect URI on Grimmory's client at your identity provider (shown on the QR
page and under Grimmory → Single sign-on (SSO) setup). Reserve the Kindle's
IP in your router. If `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is set in Grimmory, add
`http://<kindle-ip>:8642` too.

## Browsing Grimmory

Continue reading, Recently added, All books (A–Z), **Libraries**, **Authors**
(with search), **Series** (in series order) and Search. Audiobooks are left
out everywhere: Authors, Series and Libraries come from a local index of the
readable books (built in the background, refreshed daily), so authors or
series with only audiobooks don't appear, and the lists open instantly.
If Grimmory's `/app/libraries` endpoint fails (HTTP 500, a server bug seen
on some installs), the web app's library list is used instead.

Saved lists (`gzreader_listcache.lua`): the first page of every list fetched
(Continue reading, Recently added, All books, a library, shelf, author or
series, the library and shelf lists, Audiobooks) is kept on the Kindle, per
server and account (`cache/grimmory-lists`, newest 60). The Grimmory tab
opens at once, without waiting for Wi‑Fi; a list with a saved copy appears
straight away (its title ends in "· saved"), Wi‑Fi comes up quietly in the
background, and the fresh list replaces it in place (same page) when it
arrives, unless you've moved on. With no Wi‑Fi the saved copies are what you
get. "Load more" and Search always ask Grimmory.

The Grimmory tab is part of ZenOS's tab bar while it's open: the bar stays
at the bottom with the Grimmory tab underlined, and the title shows ZenOS's
status bar (clock, battery, Wi‑Fi, downloads) with the list's name and, in
a sub-list, a back arrow.

## Notes (Memos)

The Notes tab (it took Favorites' place in the tab bar, V) shows your
[Memos](https://usememos.com) notes as sticky notes, six to a page, pinned
first. Written against Memos v0.31 (`/api/v1`); newer servers that moved the
API to `/api` are found too.

- **Favorites** is still in Settings → Interface → Navbar → Tabs, turned
  off; turn it on there (or on the setup guide's Navbar Tabs page, which also
  offers Notes) to have both.
- **Connect:** the first time, the tab offers *Connect with QR code* (the
  phone page, at its Notes section: the Memos address and an access token) or
  *Connect by typing*. Create the
  token in Memos → Settings → My account → Access Tokens. The Kindle keeps
  the token (never your password) in GZreader's settings; it's never written
  to the log. An address without `https://` falls back to `http://` for a
  Memos on your home network.
- **Board:** Q–Y open a note, ◀ ▶ (or the page keys) turn pages, the 5-way
  moves around the notes. **N** new note, **F** filter, **M** for refresh,
  connect again and disconnect (the Menu key opens the Home menu in tab views).
- **A note:** the text in Patrick Hand, checklist items with letter keys
  (press one to tick or untick it; the change goes to Memos), pictures from
  the note shown inline, its tags and place, and its attachments (PDFs and
  other documents open in the reader, pictures in the image viewer; each is
  downloaded once into `cache/gzreader-notes`). **Alt+E** edits, **Alt+P**
  pins, page keys scroll a long note.
- **Editor:** a full page with a toolbar at the bottom: List, Check, Num,
  Head, *I*, **B**, # Tag and Save. **Menu** jumps to the toolbar from
  anywhere in the text (on the tool used last) and the cursor stays where it
  is, so the tool applies there; Menu again (or ▲) goes back to the text. ▼
  from the last line also reaches the toolbar; ◀ ▶ choose, Press applies. Shortcuts:
  Alt+L list, Alt+C checklist, Alt+N numbered, Alt+H heading, Alt+K italic,
  Alt+B bold, Alt+G tag, Alt+S save, Alt+V who can see it. Alt + the top
  row types 1–0 here. New notes are **private** unless you change it. Back
  asks whether to save.
- **Filters:** tag, date (today, 7 days, 30 days, a year), pinned and search
  are Memos filters; place and "with attachments" are picked out on the
  Kindle (Memos v0.31 can't filter by them).
- **Settings → Connections → Memos (Notes):** the Memos connection (connect again, disconnect);
  **Sync** all notes or only notes with chosen tags (Memos has no spaces or
  notebooks, so tags are the way to pick; the list comes from Memos' tag
  counts, `users/<id>:getStats`, and the filter is `tag in [...]`);
  **Storage used** with *Free up space* (downloaded attachments, kept
  notes); **Notes kept on the Kindle** (50–500, fetched a page at a time);
  **Attachment storage limit** (10–100 MB or none; the attachments used
  longest ago go first).
- **Wi‑Fi:** only to sync (when the tab opens, at most every 5 minutes, or with
  changes waiting; M → Refresh any time), to send a change, and to open an
  attachment not on the Kindle yet. Pictures in notes are downloaded while
  syncing (up to 2 MB each, within the attachment limit).
- **Offline:** the last list of notes is kept on the Kindle
  (`settings/gzreader-notes.json`); new notes, edits, ticks and pins made
  without Wi‑Fi wait in a queue and are sent the next time the Notes tab can
  reach Memos ("not sent yet" on the note meanwhile). The Notes tab keeps
  Wi‑Fi up while it's open (Wi‑Fi only when needed).

## Calendar (calendar links and CalDAV)

The Calendar tab (B) shows calendars from their **shared links** (webcal:// or
https://….ics: Proton Calendar's Share → Share with anyone, Google's secret
iCal address, Outlook's published ICS…) and/or a **CalDAV account**, read-only.

- **Calendar links:** add several at once on the phone page (one per line,
  `Name | link` to name one), by typing, or from `calendars.txt` (GZreader
  folder or the top of the USB drive). Each is fetched when added (named after
  its `X-WR-CALNAME`) and at every sync; `webcal://` is fetched over HTTPS,
  falling back to HTTP. Links are secret: kept in GZreader's settings, never
  logged (requests show the server only, `rawRequest`'s `log_url`). Times use
  the file's own VTIMEZONE rules; repeating events are expanded on the Kindle.
  Settings → Connections → Calendar → Calendar links: show / rename / remove,
  or the same on the phone page (*Add or edit links with QR code*), which
  also replaces a link that changed.

The CalDAV account: Nextcloud
(`https://your.server/remote.php/dav`), iCloud (`https://caldav.icloud.com`),
Fastmail (`https://caldav.fastmail.com`), Google
(`https://apidata.googleusercontent.com/caldav/v2/`), Radicale, Baïkal…

- **Connect:** Connect with QR code (the phone page: address, user name and
  password; it also shows or hides each calendar) or Connect by typing. Use an app password where the server
  has them; it's kept in GZreader's settings like the Memos token and never
  logged (the log has addresses only, and passwords are redacted from it).
  Discovery follows RFC 6764: the address → `current-user-principal` →
  `calendar-home-set` → the VEVENT calendars in it (`/.well-known/caldav` is
  tried for a bare host; a calendar's own address works too).
- **Layouts:** Agenda, Day (timeline, overlapping events side by side),
  Week (seven columns), Month (grid). Letters open an event (a day in Week);
  Press opens what the 5-way is on; a day in Week or Month opens in Day. Page
  keys (or ‹ ›): next / previous day, week, month (Agenda: the next days).
  **N** today, **M** layouts, Refresh, settings.
- **Sync:** one `calendar-query` REPORT per calendar for the sync range
  (default 14 days back, 90 ahead), asking the server to expand repeating
  events (`<C:expand>`, times in UTC). Servers that don't expand send the
  RRULE, expanded on the Kindle (DAILY / WEEKLY / MONTHLY / YEARLY with
  INTERVAL, COUNT, UNTIL, BYDAY, BYMONTHDAY; EXDATE; RECURRENCE-ID). TZID times
  that aren't expanded are read in GZreader's time zone.
- **Wi‑Fi:** only to sync, when the tab opens (at most every 15 minutes) and
  with M → Refresh. Events are kept on the Kindle (`settings/gzreader-calendar.json`).
- **Settings → Connections → Calendar (CalDAV):** connection, calendars shown,
  the layout it opens in, week start (Sunday / Monday), sync range, storage.

## Subtitles

Grimmory's subtitle is added to the title ("Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Old
School") in the Grimmory lists and, for downloaded books, as KOReader custom
metadata (`.sdr/custom_metadata.lua`, like Book information → edit title),
so Home, Downloads, history and the reader show it. The app API's lists have
no subtitles, so they come from the library index (Grimmory's web book list,
`/api/v1/books/page`) and from the book itself after a download. Titles you
edited yourself are left alone.

## Downloads screen and title bar

While anything downloads, **Downloads (N)** is the first entry of the GZreader
menu (Menu key on Home) and is in the Reading menu; it's always in Settings →
GZreader (`gzreader_tasks.lua`). It lists the current book download, the
queue, audiobook downloads and the audiobook preparing step: reopen a
progress bar, stop the download, take a book out of the queue, empty the
queue. ZenOS's status bar gets a `gz_downloads` item next to the clock
(added once; movable/removable in its settings): a download icon with the
percentage and the number waiting, refreshed every 10 s while active.

## Book covers when downloading

Picking a book in the Grimmory browser asks whether to download it and shows
Grimmory's cover thumbnail (250 x 350, `/api/v1/media/book/<id>/thumbnail`),
fetched in the background and kept in `koreader/cache/grimmory-thumbs/`
(renewed when the cover changes in Grimmory).

## Home folder and downloads

The GZreader folder (`GZreader` at the top of the Kindle's drive, `/mnt/us/GZreader`) is the home folder; the
**Downloads** tab shows it. Books sent from your phone (Home menu → Send
books from your phone) go there too. Books download in a background process with a
progress bar (percentage, MB received of the total; the Kindle stays awake
until it's done). Picking more books while one downloads queues them; they
download one after another (lists show "queued"; the download options can
empty the queue) (press any key for Stop / Continue in background / Keep
watching); a transfer that stalls for 90 s is stopped.

A backup list of downloaded books (`.gzreader-library.json`) is kept in the
GZreader folder. If KOReader's settings are lost (for example the `koreader`
folder was replaced), the books are re-linked to Grimmory from it, or by file
name from the library index, so progress sync and "on Kindle" marks keep
working.

## Shelves and auto-download

Grimmory tab → **Shelves** lists your shelves and smart (magic) shelves.
Settings → Connections → Grimmory → **Auto-download shelf** picks one: books on it that
aren't on the Kindle download in the background through the download queue
when Wi-Fi connects (at most every 30 minutes) and with "Download new books
from the shelf now". Books taken off the shelf stay on the Kindle. (Idea from
krisboho/connecto-library's Shelf Sync.)

## Progress sync

Native: Grimmory's own reading-progress API (the web reader's), not its
KOReader-compatible endpoint.

- Books downloaded through the Grimmory tab, matched by Grimmory book ID.
- EPUB: the exact place as an EPUB CFI (`positionData`, made from the
  page's crengine XPointer with `gzreader_cfi.lua`), plus the chapter (spine
  file) and the position in it as a fallback. Grimmory's web reader
  (foliate-js) resumes from the CFI; before 1.1.0 no CFI was sent and it
  opened at the start of the chapter. PDFs/comics: page. FB2/MOBI/AZW3:
  percentage.
- Percentage: worked out like foliate-js does it (each spine file counts by
  its uncompressed size, from the EPUB's zip directory; non-linear files
  count 0), so Grimmory's figure matches its web reader on the same page.
  KOReader's footer counts rendered height and still shows its own figure
  (e.g. 11% on the Kindle where the web reader says 15%).
- Pull: a CFI from the web reader is converted back to an XPointer and the
  Kindle goes to that exact page; ahead / behind / same page is decided on
  KOReader's positions for both, so the two percentage scales don't mix.
  Every page of Diary of a Wimpy Kid (230 pages, all pictures) round-trips
  through a CFI to the same page on the Kindle 3's crengine.
- Pulled on open and wake; pushed every 10 page turns (or 3 minutes), on
  close and on sleep. Pulls, page-turn pushes and queued updates run in a
  short-lived background process one at a time (`gzreader_async.lua`), so
  the page never waits for the network; JSON replies are gzip-compressed. Forward moves from other devices apply silently; going
  back asks. Offline updates are queued and sent when Wi‑Fi returns.
  Sync jumps are not added to the Back history.
- Reading sessions (30 s or longer) go to Grimmory's reading statistics.
  A session whose reply never came back (timeout, dropped connection) may
  have been saved anyway; before sending it again, GZreader looks in the
  book's session history on Grimmory for one with the same start time and
  length, and doesn't send it twice.

## Bookmark sync

Page bookmarks are kept the same on the Kindle and in Grimmory (web reader,
other devices), both ways, including deletions. EPUB bookmarks are converted
between KOReader's XPointers and Grimmory's EPUB CFIs using the book's own
XHTML (paragraph precision); PDF/comic bookmarks use the page number.
Bookmarks made offline are sent later. Synced on open and with "Sync with
Grimmory now". Switch: Grimmory menu → Sync bookmarks.

crengine makes a DocFragment for every spine item, image and SVG pages
included (checked on the Kindle 3's crengine), so DocFragment[i] is the i-th
spine item. Until 1.0.29 GZreader counted only XHTML items; books with
picture pages in the spine then fell back to percentages.

## Remote debugging

For freezes and hard reboots, where the Kindle's own log may be lost:
GZreader can report to a feed (Tianji-style `…/open/feed/<id>/send`,
`/state/upsert`, `/state/resolve`), set in Settings → General → Remote
debugging or by a `gzreader-remote.txt` file on the USB drive with the feed
address on its first line. The address is not in the code (the project is
public). `gzreader_remote.lua` queues messages as JSON files in
`koreader/gzreader-remote/spool`; `gzreader_watchdog.lua`, a separate
low-priority LuaJIT process, sends them when Wi‑Fi is on (GZreader never turns
Wi‑Fi on for them) and watches a heartbeat GZreader writes every 15 s:

| Report | When |
| --- | --- |
| GZreader started | every start: version, battery, memory, how the previous run ended |
| Previous run ended unexpectedly (important) | the last heartbeat said "running": hard reboot, battery, freeze or crash; with what it was doing, the previous run's log tail and crash.log |
| Kindle unresponsive (important) + state "GZreader unresponsive" | no heartbeat for 2 minutes while awake: memory, load, top processes, kernel messages and the log at that moment |
| Kindle responsive again + state resolved | the heartbeat is back |
| GZreader crashed (important) | the process ended without closing: crash.log and log tail |
| warnings / errors | GZreader's log warnings and errors, a minute at a time |

| GZreader slow | no heartbeat for 45 s (once per 10 min): the same snapshot |
| GZreader busy (important) | GZreader at 60% CPU or more for a minute (from the app) |
| warning "slow: …" | a keypress, repaint or round of scheduled work took 3 s or more |

Where the time goes (`gzreader_slowtrace.lua`, with remote debugging on):
LuaJIT's sampling profiler (`jit.profile`, every 50 ms of CPU time, so
nothing while idle) tallies the running code (3 frames) and whether it is
Lua, JIT code, C (e.g. crengine), garbage collection or the JIT compiler. The
tally is written to `gzreader-remote/profile` every ~5 s of CPU, also while
GZreader is stuck in one long call, and goes into the watchdog's reports,
with each GZreader process's state, CPU over 2 s, memory and wait channel.

Sleep is not a freeze (the heartbeat says "sleep", and the watchdog notices
the clock jump after waking). Log lines are redacted (no passwords or
tokens). Checked with the Kindle 3's LuaJIT against a local feed: queued
messages, the freeze alert with its snapshot, "responsive again", the crash
report, and no crash report after a normal close.

## Unfinished downloads

Every book download (running or queued) and every audiobook download and
"preparing the audio" is noted when it starts and crossed off when it ends
(`gzreader_recovery.lua`). If GZreader stops in between (battery ran out,
the Kindle slept or restarted, a crash), it asks about each one a few
seconds after the next start: **Continue** (books continue from the part
already downloaded with an HTTP Range request; audiobooks continue
downloading their tracks and preparing the ones not yet converted, after
stopping any conversion still running from before), **Delete** (removes
the part) or **Ignore** (stops asking, keeps the part: downloading it again
later still continues from there). A stalled download now also keeps its
part. Stopping a download yourself, taking it out of the queue, or a "not
found" from Grimmory clears it.

## Highlight and note sync

EPUB highlights and notes are kept the same on the Kindle and in Grimmory's
web reader (and other devices), both ways: new ones, colour and style
changes, notes, deletions. The conversion and three-way merge are vendored
from [Grimmory-KOReader-Client](https://github.com/ManorianOTP/Grimmory-KOReader-Client)
(MIT; `gzreader_cfi.lua`, `gzreader_annosync.lua`, `gzreader_slaxml.lua`, see
`plugins/gzreader.koplugin/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`); the orchestration is
`gzreader_annotations.lua`.

- A highlight is two crengine XPointers in KOReader and an EPUB CFI range with
  UTF-16 offsets in Grimmory (`epubcfi(/6/2[c1]!/4/6,/2/1:7,/3:4)`), converted
  with the book's own XHTML. Checked against the Kindle 3's crengine: every
  word range of a test book (nested inline tags, accents, an emoji, a `<br/>`,
  a picture page in the spine, `%20` and `../` in hrefs) converts to a CFI and
  back to the same text.
- Each pass compares the Kindle's highlights, Grimmory's, and what both had
  after the last clean pass (kept per book). A change on one side is copied
  to the other. A highlight changed on both sides since then is a conflict:
  each side keeps its own until they agree. Grimmory can't move a highlight's
  range, so a moved range is not overwritten either.
- When the reply to a new highlight is lost, the next pass finds it on
  Grimmory by its range and links it, so it isn't made twice (a repeat send
  gets 409 "already exists", which counts as sent).
- Colours: yellow, green, cyan, pink, orange, red, purple, blue, gray, white ⇄
  Grimmory's hex colours; styles: highlight, underline, strikeout, squiggly.
- Runs a few seconds after a Grimmory EPUB opens, a few seconds after you add,
  change or delete a highlight or note (when Wi‑Fi is on), with "Sync with
  Grimmory now", and when the book closes with changes still waiting.
- The chapter parsing, conversions and requests run in one low-priority
  background process; only the merge into the open book happens on screen.
  Highlights already linked keep their conversion, so only new ones parse
  their chapters, and chapters are parsed once per pass.
- Page bookmarks stay with bookmark sync. Switch: Grimmory menu → Sync
  highlights and notes.

## Read aloud (Kindle 3 text-to-speech)

Uses the Kindle's own voice (Amazon's speech service, reached over lipc
with the Kindle's `lipc-hash-prop` tool, run in the background so the screen
never waits; KOReader's lipc library doesn't load on the Kindle 3).
Shift + Sym (or Reading menu → Read aloud) starts and stops. The sentence
being read is highlighted and pages turn by themselves. EPUB/FB2/MOBI/AZW3
and text only.

Amazon never documented the request format. The speech daemon (`ttsd`)
writes which field it's missing to the system log ("unable to read id"), so
Reading menu → Read-aloud settings → Find the Kindle voice adds the missing
fields one by one until `ttsd` accepts the request, plays "Voice test" and
asks whether you heard it; the request shape is then saved. Text goes to the voice a
sentence at a time (split only when a sentence passes 30 words at a comma,
semicolon, colon or dash, or 80 words; paragraph and heading ends always end
a piece); web addresses are left out. When a sentence runs onto the next
page, the page turns part-way through, at the share of the sentence's
characters already said. The speech
service doesn't report when a sentence ends, so the next sentence starts
after a time computed from its length and the speed setting (Read-aloud
settings → Slower / Faster). The diagnostic log records every step.

## Audiobooks (experimental)

Grimmory tab → Audiobooks.
Pick one to download it to `Grimmory/Audiobooks/<id>/` (single M4B file,
converted for the Kindle, or one file per track for folder audiobooks), then the player opens:

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| 5-way press / Space | Play / pause |
| Left / Right | Back / forward 30 s |
| Up / Down | Previous / next chapter |
| Q / W / E | Chapters / sleep timer (15–60 min, end of chapter) / stop |
| A / S | Quieter / louder |
| D | About this book: Grimmory's description, narrator, length |
| Menu | About, chapters, sleep timer, stop |
| Back | Close the screen (keeps playing; reopen from Home or Downloads → Audiobooks) |
| Home | Home (keeps playing) |
| Volume buttons | Volume, here and anywhere in GZreader (a note shows the level) |

Pause stops the player process and remembers the place; play starts it
again from there (MP3: to the nearest 4 KB; M4B: from the AAC frame playing
when paused). The Kindle 3's sound pipeline doesn't come back from a
suspended process, and a stopped one also frees the sound device for read
aloud. Sleep (the power switch) pauses; leaving GZreader (Exit to the
Kindle's menu, a restart) stops the audiobook and read aloud.

Position syncs with Grimmory's audiobook progress (same fields as its web
player: position in the track and track index), every minute while
playing, on pause and on stop; offline updates are queued. The Kindle
doesn't go to sleep while audio plays; pressing the power button pauses.
The book's description comes from Grimmory with the download (and, for
audiobooks downloaded before 1.6.2, the next time the player opens online);
Home's featured book shows it too.

Playback uses what the Kindle 3 has: GStreamer 0.10 (`gst-launch-0.10`)
with Freescale's hardware decoders `mfw_mp3decoder` and `mfw_aacdecoder`,
into ALSA. MP3 starts anywhere (the file is fed from the right byte offset).
There is no MP4 demuxer on the Kindle, so an M4B is converted once after
download (`gzreader_mp4.lua`: each AAC frame gets an ADTS header; no
re-encoding) into ~15-second pieces in `<file>.chunks/`; playback starts at
the piece holding the position and feeds the following ones to the AAC
decoder. **Test audio playback** tries the pipelines with a short MP3 and an
AAC tune (converted from the bundled M4A, which also tests the converter),
asks which you heard and remembers it.

Downloads use Grimmory's audiobook stream endpoints and resume with HTTP
Range after a dropped connection or timeout.

The conversion runs as a separate `luajit gzreader_mp4.lua <in> <dir>
<progress>` process at nice 19 (~8 MB for a long book; sample tables are
read in 64 KB blocks), with a progress bar fed from its progress file. A
fork of KOReader isn't used for it: the fork's copy of KOReader's heap gets
duplicated page by page as its garbage collector runs, which ran the
Kindle 3 out of memory in 1.0.21.

## Picture books

EPUBs whose chapter files are pictures with next to no text (scanned pages,
e.g. Diary of a Wimpy Kid: 385 x 625 JPEG per page) are recognized on
opening (`gzreader_picturebook.lua`: sampled spine files, ≥ 70 % pictures-only).
GZreader then adds a book style tweak (`img { height: 100%; width: auto;
max-width: 100% }`, no margins/padding), sets the book's page margins to 0
and turns on smooth image scaling, keeping the old settings for when it's
turned off (Reading menu → Fit pictures to the screen). Checked with the
Kindle's own crengine.

`100%` is the page area between the top and bottom margins (ZenOS adds its
title-bar height to the top margin), so pictures stay clear of the title bar
and footer. 1.0.28 used `100vh`, the whole screen: pages ran under the clock
and the footer (crengine also split them, adding blank pages), and a wide
picture capped at the screen width was stretched to full height. With `100%`
crengine keeps each picture's shape. The scans are only ~385 x 625, so
they're enlarged about 1.3x to fill 800 pixels; that's why they look softer
than real text. Smooth scaling makes them much less jagged.

## Sleep screen

While a book is open: its cover. From Home and menus: a random picture from
the USB drive's `screensavers` folder (created by the setup guide), falling
back to the Kindle's own sleep pictures. Chosen in the setup guide; picking
another option there, choosing a wallpaper in the sleep-screen menu, or
applying a ZenOS sleep-screen preset switches it off and uses that choice.

"Show custom image (book cover while reading)" (KOReader's "custom image or
cover"): the chosen image from Home and menus, the open book's cover while
reading. In KOReader it showed the custom image everywhere.

## Wi-Fi only when needed

On by default (Settings → General → Wi-Fi only when needed). GZreader turns
Wi-Fi on by itself when it needs the network and off again after a minute
unused, as long as nothing still needs it (an open Grimmory browser, a
download or its queue, the library index, a QR screen, an update download).

| When | Wi-Fi |
| --- | --- |
| Browsing Grimmory, downloading, connecting, sending the log, checking for / installing updates | turned on ("Connecting to Wi-Fi…") |
| A Grimmory book opens | turned on quietly: pull the position, send queued changes, sync bookmarks, highlights and notes |
| A book closes with unsent changes (position, session, highlights) | turned on quietly to send them |
| Wake after 15 min or more with a book open | turned on quietly to pull the position |
| Page turns, bookmarks, highlights, sleep | not turned on: changes wait for the next sync |
| Daily update check, library index refresh | only if Wi-Fi is already on |

Wi-Fi you turned on yourself is never turned off. Going to sleep turns off
Wi-Fi GZreader turned on.


Wi‑Fi you turn off yourself (Wi‑Fi menu, quick panel, Home menu: KOReader's
interactive switch) stays off for background work (syncs when a book opens
or closes, after waking, Notes, Calendar, the auto-download shelf) until you
turn it on again, also after a restart (`gzreader_wifi_kept_off`). Things you
ask for still connect.
## Speed on the Kindle 3

- **Drawing with the C blitter** (`frontend/device/kindle/shadowfb.lua`).
  KOReader's fast C blitter doesn't handle the Kindle 2 / DX / 3's 4-bit
  framebuffer, so every glyph, icon and cover was drawn pixel by pixel in
  Lua: most of the CPU time of each key press. KOReader now draws into an
  8-bit shadow screen with the C blitter, and just before each e-ink refresh
  the refreshed rectangle is packed into the framebuffer (two pixels per
  byte, the panel's inverted levels, physical coordinates so rotation works).
  The result is byte-for-byte what drawing into the framebuffer gave
  (`tools/gzreader/emulator/shadow_test.lua`); in the emulator everyday keys
  take about a third less CPU and start-up is faster. Off: a file named
  `gz-no-shadow-screen` in the `koreader` folder.
- **Night mode works again**, at no cost: it's done while packing (the device
  reports hardware inversion), so drawing is the same as by day.
- **Bytecode cache for source installs** (`frontend/gzbytecode.lua`): when
  the Lua files are source (an update from GitHub's source archive, a
  development copy), each module's bytecode is kept in
  `cache/gz-bytecode/<LuaJIT, version>/` the first time it loads (about 4x
  faster to load after that). Release packages are precompiled already, and
  then it does nothing. Off: a file named `gz-no-bytecode` in the `koreader`
  folder.
- **Opening books**: each open logs a timing line (`gzreader_opentiming.lua`:
  closing the file manager, opening and laying out the document, each
  module's ReaderReady, screen refreshes, free memory). The crengine layout
  cache is 256 MB instead of 64 (a dropped layout means a full re-layout on
  the next open), and `LuaSettings:flush` skips writing a file whose content
  hasn't changed (opening a book wrote `settings.reader.lua` twice).
- **5-way focus on Home** refreshes only the old and the new focus boxes
  (quick mode), and the Home key from Settings or the audiobook player makes
  one refresh.
- Lua is shipped as precompiled bytecode (see Rebuild the package): no parsing
  at start (~4x faster loading overall, up to 15x for big files).

- Covers are pre-sized (Settings → Interface → Pre-size covers). ZenOS scales
  every cover to the exact size of where it's shown; on the Kindle 3 that took
  ~4 s of CPU per Home screen (the cover strip), and its memory cache starts
  empty after every restart. GZreader keeps each final-size cover as a raw
  bitmap in `koreader/cache/gz-covers/` (used only while the book file is
  unchanged), learns the sizes ZenOS uses, and a low-priority background
  process (`gzreader_coverwarm.lua`) makes them for every downloaded book a
  minute after start, after downloads and when a new size shows up. Books
  whose cover hasn't been read yet go through KOReader's cover extraction
  first.

- Night mode on the Kindle 2, DX and Keyboard is done while packing the
  shadow screen (above). On the Kindle 4 (no shadow screen) it stays off and
  can't be switched on: it has no hardware screen inversion, and KOReader's
  software inversion is too slow there.

- The removed CJK font was still listed as a fallback, so every missing
  glyph made KOReader try to load it again (dozens of errors per screen in
  the log). Missing fallbacks are now dropped at start.
- ZenOS's Home "quotes" row (about 0.5 s per Home rebuild) is off by default.
- ZenOS's icon font is no longer registered with the book renderer (it
  failed every time).
- The first open of a big EPUB is slow (crengine renders and caches it; 28 s
  seen for a large book). Later opens use the cache.

## Diagnostic log

**Send it to your phone:** Diagnostics in the Home or Reading menu, or Settings →
General → Send diagnostic log to my phone (QR code). Scan the code (same Wi-Fi), tap Download, then attach
the file wherever you need it.


`koreader/gzreader.log` (rotates at 512 KB): requests with status and timing,
pairing, SSO, downloads, sync, bookmarks, updates, read aloud. Passwords and
tokens are never written. Grimmory → Save diagnostic log copies it, the tail
of `crash.log` and a read-only audio/speech survey next to the Grimmory
folder.

## Rebuild the package

```sh
tools/gzreader/package-kindle.sh koreader-kindle-legacy-v2026.07.1.zip out/   # Kindle 2, DX, 3
tools/gzreader/package-kindle.sh koreader-kindle-v2026.07.1.zip out/          # Kindle 4, Kindle Touch
tools/gzreader/package-kindle.sh koreader-kindlehf-v2026.07.1.zip out/        # touch, firmware 5.16.3+
tools/gzreader/package-kindle.sh koreader-kindlepw2-v2026.07.1.zip out/       # touch, firmware 5.6.1–5.16.2
```

The branch changes only Lua and shell scripts, so the script overlays it onto
the official release built from the same tag rather than rebuilding the
native toolchain.

It then precompiles every Lua file under `frontend/`, `plugins/` and
`common/` to LuaJIT bytecode with the release's own `luajit` (run through
`qemu-arm-static`; needs `qemu-user-static`, `libc6-armel-cross` and
`libgcc-s1-armel-cross`, or `libc6-armhf-cross` for the `kindlehf`
package; `GZ_LUAJIT` can name another package's `luajit` of the same
version instead: the bytecode is the same), keeping the `.lua` names and debug info (line
numbers, upvalue names, source paths), so loading skips parsing. Without
qemu it warns and ships source. `GZ_BYTECODE=0` turns it off.
